# Final Project: Proving Turing Completeness of Magic: The Gathering in ACL2
## Authors: Leonid Belyaev and Samuel Lyon

### Setup

To setup and load the relevant files, first [install ACL2](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-0/HTML/installation/installation.html) on your system, and certify the community books `ACL2s` and `lists-light`. The Debian ACL2 package does not currently work- it is recommended to build ACL2 from source for maximum compatibility. 

From there, one may load the files into their ACL2 session using the [`ld` command](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/index-seo.php/ACL2____LD).
