# Final Project: Proving Turing Completeness of Magic: The Gathering in ACL2
### Authors: Leonid Belyaev and Samuel Lyon

# Introduction
The aim of our project is to demonstrate that the game Magic: The Gathering (henceforth MTG)is capable of embedding a Universal Turing machine, and is thus both Turing complete in its ruleset and undecidable. Our project specifically proves that operations on a sequence of "creature tokens", cards in the game which encode symbols on a Turing machine, leave the sequence of cards **well-formed**: each time the game advances analogously to the UTM(2, 18), the cards describe a properly constructed input tape for a Turing machine.

Our project was completed in ACL2, and requires a great deal of lemmata to get working. We develop an interpreter for a UTM(2, 18), or a Universal Turing machine with 2 states and 18 symbols, as described in Yurii Rogozhin's *Small universal Turing machines*.[^1] We use existing interpreters, such as the one found [here](http://www.nearly42.org/misc/tm/tm.html) and on [Replit](https://repl.it/@Quantumplation/UTM218) to ensure the soundness of our interpreter, since it serves as the source of truth for our project.

We also write various lemmata to build up to our final proof, and ensure the soundness of our additional functions. These will be discussed in detail below.

We use the `lists-light` library, which is part of the ACL2 community books. Specifically, we use the `perm` and `memberp` functions, along with their associated lemmata and equivalence/congruence relations to prove our own lemmata and main theorem.

Finally, our work is inspired by the paper *Magic: The Gathering is Turing Complete* by Churchill et al.[^2] as we model the system laid out in this paper which embeds a UTM(2, 18) in the MTG card game. J Strother Moore's *Proof Pearl: Proving a Simple Von Neumann Machine Turing Complete*[^3] and its accompanying code in the ACL2 community book `models/jvm/m1` served as the starting point and inspiration for the structure of our project, though we have since pivoted in both direction and scope.

# Background

There is no existing implementation of the proof that MTG is Turing complete, in any automated theorem prover, as far as we know. As such, this project serves as a first attempt to implement a working proof (or part of one) of Turing equivalence in a system where it was not intended. The UTM(2, 18) is a popular machine used to show that systems such as video games are Turing equivalent. This project also stands as the first attempt of modelling one of these systems alongside a UTM(2, 18) in an automated theorem prover. 

Our data types begin with a working implementation of a UTM(2, 18). We model the *production functions* for the universal Turing machine, often called *instructions* in other machines, as 5-tuples, with a state *q1* and a symbol *s1* expressing that this function should be read when the machine is in state *q1*, and the interpreter reads *s1* from the input tape. The remaining values are another symbol to write to the tape, a direction for the head position to move in, and a new state to transition the interpreter into. We model the tape with a cons list of symbols, corresponding to those used by Rogozhin in his paper.

Our other data types are analogous to those presented in MTG, with some simplifications made. We model the production functions, or [Rotlung Reanimators](https://scryfall.com/card/ons/164/rotlung-reanimator)/[Xathrid Necromancers](https://scryfall.com/card/c20/141/xathrid-necromancer) similarly to those in the UTM. These are 4-tuples, consisting of a state and creature name expressing that this Rotlung/Xathrid card has its ability triggered, a single *creature* which it produces, and a new state to transition into. *Creatures* represent a symbol on the tape much like the UTM tape, but they also contain positional information regarding where they are on the tape- for MTG's "battlefield" is not ordered. The creature with 2 power and 2 toughness is always at the head, and other creatures all have power and toughness greater than this, representing how far offset from the head they are. All creatures are either *green*, indicating that they are to the left of the head, *white*, indicating that they are to the right, or *blue*, which is only the case when the creature token which halts the game, the assassin, is written to the tape. A creature's color additionally indicates what direction the tape should move in once the creature is written to the head of the tape.

To move the tape, the players cast spells which deal damage to or empower creatures, raising their *power* or *toughness*, which will shift them along the tape. These are represented by functions which operate on every creature on the tape (`snuffers`) or creatures of a specified color (`vigor-beam`) so that at each movement step, one set of creatures is shifted left and another is shifted right.

# Walkthrough

We first implement a tag system and UTM(2, 18) in ACL2, to ensure that our domain knowledge of the task ahead was sufficient. Using existing models, we set both of these machines up to terminate on certain example programs. Once these worked correctly, they served as a source of truth for the output of the MTG interpreter.

We now shift files to MTG, where our first steps mirror those performed with UTM. We define an interpreter for this "MTGTM" following the structure described above. The first step in defining the well-formedness of MTGI is the re-ordering of the battlefield- our tape. After defining a comparator on creatures, and testing it for symmetry and transitivity, we define an insertion sort on the battlefield. We now have everything we need to transfer the creatures of the battlefield into the tape representation used in UTM- that is, a list of two half-tapes, where the green creatures make up the left half-tape, and the white creatures the right. Another reduction- that from creature types to simple characters- gets us closer to the UTM. 

Now, we delve into lemmas with the objective of separating us from `MTGI`- that is, we wish to prove ultimately that `MTGI` is equivalent to a new machine `mtg-ord`, which operates on the modified tape that we just generated. This `mtg-ord`, in turn, would be connected to `utmi`- and so, by transitivity, `mtgi` would be isomorphic to `utmi`, and `mtgi` would be Turing complete.

With this objective in mind, we wish to assert the well-formedness of our insertion sort. That is, given a battlefield of creatures, the insertion sort operation should always sort that list correctly. As a subgoal, we wish to demonstrate that insertion sort produces a permutation of its input, a result that requires several sub-lemmata. 

## Results

## Personal Progress

Our work with UTM and MTG was certainly enlightening. While we set out with the seemingly straightforward objective of proving the Turing equivalence of UTM and MTGI using theorems A and B, per  we soon discovered that this objective was a bit more than we could pull off. Once we had internalized all of the relevant research, we set about putting it all together. As a trial run, we worked on implementing a tag system in ACL2- the high level computational model to be embedded into a Turing machine. This exercise did not present significant problems. The next step was to implement the UTM itself- that is, the Turing machine in which this tag system was to be embedded. This too was relatively straightforward. Moore's work[^4] served as a useful guide in this exercise, and we adopted several of his design choices that we found useful. We now could begin work on MTG.

In initializing our work, MTG was definitely more difficult than UTM and MTG, as we now had several layers of choices to make- how much of the card game proper should we implement into our Turing machine emulator? It has turn-taking, cloaking states, tapping states, and other details- not to mention that this MTG Turing machine takes a considerable about of in-game setup to pull off, utilizing many modifier cards from across the game's long run[^5]. If our models of MTG are too high-level, we risk failing to achieve much in the way of reasoning about their Turing completeness in relation to UTM. Many, many reductions would have to take place, and the final result would be a computationally heavy proof indeed. On the other hand, we may use a more reduced representation of MTG. At its most basic level, this MTG TM is, after all, a UTM[^6]- and we might implicitly reduce nearly all of it down to UTM if we so desired. This approach, however, obviously makes for a less interesting result. We opted for something towards this interesting side of the spectrum. We keep all of the implementation details which made UTM meaningfully different from MTG, but strip out cloaking states, tapping, and turn-taking, which we saw as contributing nothing meaningful to the final product.
