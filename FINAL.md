# Final Project: Proving Turing Completeness of Magic: The Gathering in ACL2
### Authors: Leonid Belyaev and Samuel Lyon

Magic: The Gathering is a widely popular trading card game developed by Wizards of the Coast. In the game, two players battle with a fixed-size deck of cards, consisting entirely of their own choice of cards within the deck. Players have thousands of cards to choose from when they build their deck, lending the game to a deep variety in strategy, and difficulty in choosing an optimal path through the game algorithmically. Churchill et al. showed that optimal play of Magic: The Gathering (MTG from here on) is generally undecidable[1], proving this by demonstrating how two players can embed a Universal Turing Machine (UTM) with 2 states and 18 symbols
